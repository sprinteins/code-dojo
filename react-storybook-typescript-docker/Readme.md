## Code Kata

We practice the TDD cycle with Front-End technologies.

> **TDD:**
> RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR

We will go in rounds and in every round somebody is responsible for tests
the others for implementation.
If the round has ended the next person is responsible for the tests.

Let's say we have four people: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`

* **Round 1**  
  * `A` writes a test until it is red.
  * `B` writes code to make the test green, than refactors it.
  * `A` writes the next test until it is red.
  * `C` writes code to make the test green, than refactors it.
  * `A` writes the next test until it is red.
  * `D` writes code to make the test green, than refactors it.
  * The round has ended.  
* **Round 2**
  * Now `B` will write tests and the other (including `A`) will make them green
